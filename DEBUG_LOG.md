# BEACN Desktop Linux Debug Log

Last Updated: [Current Date]

## Current State

### 1. Core Architecture
- Successfully implemented PipeWire integration for virtual audio devices
- Basic structure for device creation, volume control, and mute functionality is in place
- Thread synchronization has been improved but still needs work

### 2. Main Issues
- Commands are hanging/timing out during execution
- Thread synchronization issues between PipeWire event loop and Node.js
- Cleanup and initialization sequence needs refinement

### 3. Recent Changes
- Modified cleanup sequence to prevent deadlocks
- Simplified thread locking in event handlers
- Improved error handling and state management
- Removed unnecessary waits after volume/mute operations

### 4. Current Focus
- Fixing thread synchronization issues that cause commands to hang
- Ensuring proper cleanup between operations
- Making volume and mute controls more reliable

## Next Steps

### 1. Thread Synchronization
- Need to verify that all PipeWire operations are performed in the correct thread context
- Ensure proper locking/unlocking sequence in all operations
- Add better error handling for thread loop operations

### 2. State Management
- Implement better state tracking for devices
- Add proper error recovery when operations fail
- Ensure cleanup is thorough and doesn't leave dangling resources

### 3. Testing Needed
- Test device creation with various configurations
- Verify volume and mute controls work reliably
- Check cleanup and reinitialization behavior
- Test error recovery scenarios

## Known Issues

### Critical
1. Commands hanging during execution
2. Thread synchronization causing deadlocks
3. Cleanup not always complete

### To Investigate
1. Why volume changes don't persist between sessions
2. Proper handling of PipeWire stream states
3. Better error reporting from native code to JavaScript

## Last Attempted Fix
- Modified cleanup sequence to stop thread loop before cleaning up resources
- Simplified locking in event handlers
- Improved error handling in volume and mute operations

## Next Planned Fix
- Review and improve thread synchronization in stream operations
- Add better state tracking for devices
- Implement more robust error recovery

## Code Areas to Focus On

### beacn_native.cc
1. Thread synchronization in:
   - `create_virtual_device`
   - `set_volume`
   - `set_mute`
   - Event handlers

2. Cleanup sequence in:
   - `cleanup`
   - `cleanup_pipewire`

3. State management in:
   - Stream event handlers
   - Core event handlers

## Notes
- Need to ensure proper thread context for all PipeWire operations
- Consider adding more detailed logging for debugging
- May need to revisit the overall architecture of thread management
